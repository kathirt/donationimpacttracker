## Security Assessment

### Strengths
- ‚úÖ No critical security vulnerabilities in custom code
- ‚úÖ Input validation and sanitization implemented
- ‚úÖ Environment variables properly configured
- ‚úÖ Security headers configured
- ‚úÖ CORS properly configured
- ‚úÖ CodeQL analysis passed with 0 alerts

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: 9 remaining (react-scripts related)
   - Recommendation: Consider migrating to Vite or Next.js
   - Alternative: Accept risk as vulnerabilities are in dev dependencies

2. **Authentication**: Currently anonymous
   - Recommendation: Implement Azure AD B2C
   - Add proper user authentication and authorization

3. **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented
   - Recommendation: Add rate limiting to API endpoints
   - Implement request throttling

4. **Logging**: Basic console logging
   - Recommendation: Implement Application Insights
   - Add structured logging

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- ‚úÖ Well-organized project structure
- ‚úÖ Consistent naming conventions
- ‚úÖ TypeScript used throughout
- ‚úÖ Component-based architecture
- ‚úÖ Separation of concerns (components, services, utils)

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Testing**: No test coverage
   - Recommendation: Add Jest and React Testing Library
   - Target: 80% coverage for components, 90% for utilities

2. **Bundle Size**: 601 KB (larger than recommended)
   - Recommendation: Implement code splitting
   - Use dynamic imports for routes
   - Target: < 500 KB gzipped

3. **Performance**: No optimization implemented
   - Recommendation: Add React.memo for expensive components
   - Implement virtualization for large lists
   - Add lazy loading for images
